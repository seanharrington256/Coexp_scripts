## Pleistocene glaciation drives shared coexpansion in snakes of eastern North America

### Harrington, Overcast, Myers, and Burbrink



This is a repo contains code used for analyses in the manuscript "Pleistocene glaciation drives shared coexpansion in snakes of eastern North America".

Raw sequence data WILL BE AVAILABLE WHEN I UPLOAD THEM TO NCBI!!

* All processed data files (e.g, output from ipyrad, downloaded bioclim data, etc.) WILL BE available on Dryad at XXXXXXXX


- `Pop_assign_coexp.R` runs sNMF and DAPC on assemblies from ipyrad
- `IBD_coexp.R` generates kernel density plots of isolation by distance and prepares bioclim and envirem data for GDM analysis
- `GDM_coexp.R` runs generalized dissimilarity modeling (GDM)
